# ClientUsagePredictor (Linear Regression Model)

This was a project undertaken as part of an Internship in July-October 2021 and further developed in Casual Work period of November 2021-February 2022 and predicts whether a client will significantly increase or decrease their use of the company's online service this week, based on the data collected in the previous week. 

The module contains two .py scripts (one more in the folder Initial.py).

Details such as implementation and the data science theory behind the model can be found in Documentation_(LR).pdf.

As part of company protocols all raw company data were removed from this repository, and thus as the code were tailor-made based on the company's data it may be rather difficult to understand what is going on - the "Data Science Decisions" in Documentation_(LR).pdf may better represent my ideas. As the output of the scripts contained client names, these were also removed when pushed to Github.


The Flask folder contains scripts which support a Flask Web application interface for the predictor.

As part of the experimental stage of this project, 8880 different models were trained and tested by script to determine the final best model.
